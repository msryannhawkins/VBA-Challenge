# VBA-Challenge
In this challenge, we were given a heafty set of stock data. We were tasked with creating a script that looped through all stocks for the year and output the following:
    ticker symbol,
    the yearly change for each sheet,
    the percent change within each sheet,
    and the total stock volume for each stock on each sheet.
Then, we were to code for loops and if statements which produces a summary table on each sheet. These summary tables were expected to define the greatest percent increse, percent decrease, and total volume along with their corresponding ticker.
I ensured my script ran productively on each sheet simultanously as well as color code the negatove and positive changes accordingly.
